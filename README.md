## F.U.C.C (Team leader)
I"m F.U.C.C! I'm a perfectly normal 9-grade student currently without any life problems who is a beginner programmer with leading skills. I also like gameing, which is my primary hobby. I can draw simple art well. I sometimes post on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNuONlelPahjCErOUYbNDKw) when I feel like it.

## Cubetive (Head programmer)
Hello, I'm Cubetive! A student who has passion in Technology and has intentions to learn Computer Science and work in the industry. I'm also an indie developer that has developed some small games, published on itch.io. I have a Youtube channel, too, so if you want to support me, subscribe to my channel! :D
