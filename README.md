# About Me
I'm a random guy who is making a card game inspired from Undercards not about the most popular and favourite series, Henry Stickmin. We are a team of (currently) 1 people: Eagleclaw.

## Eagle (Team leader)
Hi, I'm Eagle 

## Eagle (Head programmer)
Hi, I'm eagle! 

## Eagle (sprite Artist)
hi, I'm Eagle!

## Eagle (Secondary Progamer)
Hi, i'm Eagle 

## Eagle (Guy who makes money)
Hi, im EAgle! 


# The game
As mentioned before, you're expecting this to be a card game like Undercards, but without Henry Stickmin characters in it!
**The game is still in early developement!**
